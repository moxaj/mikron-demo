# mikron.demo

This is a simple demo project demonstrating the cross-platform usage of [mikron](https://github.com/moxaj/mikron). Simply fire up the server (by evaluating the `mikron-demo.server` namespace), visit `localhost:8080`, and open the developer tab.

What happens:

1. the **client**, upon loading, opens a websocket connection to the **server**
2. the **server** generates a message, packs it, and sends it to the **client**
3. the **client** unpacks the received message, prints it, packs it, and sends it back to the **server**
4. the **server** unpacks the received message and compares it to the original
